# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm YvnUnix
I am a software developer from France and a UNIX-type system user. I successfully ran GNU/Linux for about 10 years, then moved to FreeBSD for about 3 years, and now have moved to Apple with macOS, which runs on the Darwin kernel that contains subsystem from FreeBSD. It's safe to say that I'm a UNIX user. I was a little bit worried that macOS would be too restricted for my liking, but the last year or so working on Mac has been... amazing! So much so that I decided to learn more about it and start writing software for that specific platform. Other than that, I love reading books, traveling to learn new things, and I am also interested in science and mathematics.

Everything that has to do with the apple eco-system. I enjoy learning about systems design and builing app to solve real live problÃ¨ms. I'm also interested in learning more about system design and kenel extention developement. I find this topic extremly interesting. 

## ðŸŒ± I now learning ...
iOS development has been really fun to learn, and building native iOS apps with Swift and the SwiftUI framework has been a great experience. I've also learned C and C++ basics, and I look forward to learning more about these languages that I find really interesting.
