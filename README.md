# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm YvnUnix
I am a software developer from France and a UNIX-type system user. I successfully ran GNU/Linux for about 10 years, then moved to FreeBSD for about 3 years, and now have moved to Apple with macOS, which runs on the Darwin kernel. It's safe to say that I'm a UNIX user. I was a little bit worried that macOS would be too restricted for my liking, but the last year or so working on Mac has been... amazing! So much so that I decided to learn more about it and start writing software for that specific platform. Other than that, I love reading books, traveling to learn new things, and I am also interested in science and mathematics.

I interested in learning more about the the platform
